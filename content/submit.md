#### 1. Official data sources

Please answer regarding **official (government or government associated)** sources of data. Often data is available from various sources both official and unofficial but we only want answers on the basis of official sources.

To illustrate: suppose election results data is available both from government sources and from a third party website and that the government data is in PDF (so **not** machine readable) but that the unofficial source has the data in spreadsheets (machine-readable). Then the answer to the machine readable question would be **'No'** as the official source is not machine readable (but please do list the unofficial source in the details and comments section).

#### 2. Provide evidence

Please try to provide **relevant evidence to back up responses**. For example, if data is public and online the URL field should not be empty, or, if the data is openly licensed there should be information (e.g. link) for relevant license of terms-of-use in the details.

#### 3. Assessment Point

Questions should be answered on the basis of the situation as of today. Do **not** answer based on what may happen in the future (or the situation previously). So, for example, if data will be online soon but is not online now the answer to the 'online' question should be 'No' (though please mention that it *will* be available in the details and comments section).
