  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Submission</strong>: Contributors submit information about the availability (or not) of key datasets in their country (for example Budgets in Brasil).</li>
    <li><strong>Review</strong>: submissions are reviewed by a Country Editor before being posted live on the website.</li>
    <li><strong>Assessment</strong>: Country Editors either approve (with or without amendments) or reject the submission.</li>
    <li><strong>Published</strong>: if approved, these submissions become an official entry in the Open Data Index and are displayed on the website.</li>
  </ol>
