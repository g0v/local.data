## Database v3 - Feb 18 2014

Code Release: v3

Code SHA: ac2aca9c1a08cde12c307166887693e9f3d4aa4f (last related commit)

See also 97bee55339ecd4a50985d8d843817cb01312d768 for fields other than censusid.

Introduction of fields to Submission table:

* censusid
* licenseurl
* title
* publisher
* qualityinfo
* qualitystructure

Repurpose submitterid. Existing submitterid values are no longer valid so you
MUST move any existing submitterid column to e.g. submitterid_old and introduce
new submitterid column (note we do not use submitterid yet so nothing will
break right now if you don't do this but will cause problems in the future).

Introduction of fields to Entries table:

* censusid
* licenseurl
* title
* publisher
* qualityinfo
* qualitystructure

## Database v2

## Database v1
